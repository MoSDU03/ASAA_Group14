\section{Related Work}

This work builds upon three research areas: architecture description languages, event-driven systems, and formal verification.

EAST-ADL provides a systematic framework for automotive embedded systems with vehicle, analysis, and design levels~\cite{eastadl_blom}. We apply this methodology to industrial automation, demonstrating its broader applicability. Friedenthal et al.~\cite{friedenthal2014} present SysML for systems engineering; we adopt its behavioral diagrams with precise semantics enabling translation to formal models.

Jepsen et al.~\cite{jepsen2019} analyze Industry 4.0 middleware architectures, highlighting the flexibility versus predictability trade-off in event-driven systems. Our contribution shows that timeout guards and careful QoS configuration achieve both. Buschmann et al.~\cite{buschmann2007} discuss asynchronous messaging patterns; we extend this with formal verification to guarantee timing properties.

Bengtsson et al.~\cite{bengtsson2004} present UPPAAL for real-time system verification using timed automata. Kang et al.~\cite{kang2015} verify automotive software timing properties in EAST-ADL. We apply similar techniques to industrial control and validate predictions empirically, demonstrating correlation between formal models and actual behavior.
